# Wisecoco 7.8" LCD Display Stand

STL/CAD Files for the Wisecoco 7.8" LCD Stand plus some screenshots. The display is meant to go inside of your Gaming PC as a secondary display
to show things like CPU/GPU core temperatures but can also be used as a mini secondary monitor. If you wanted to use it as a secondary monitor though it doesn't come with a stand so I created one!
